# Gimmi

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.10.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `npm run e2e` to execute the smoke tests ([Playwright](https://playwright.dev/), `e2e/`). Once per machine: `npx playwright install chromium`.

They cover the six core flows (register, log in, create a wish, reserve, give feedback, share) and run against the shared test environment (`https://gimmi-test.pages.dev` with the `test-gimmi` API). Every run registers new users with a unique e-mail address and removes them (and their wishes) afterwards through the API (`DELETE /api/people/:id`). If a run was aborted, `npm run e2e:cleanup` removes the leftovers; it only touches accounts named Smoke Eigenaar/Gever/Opruimer with an e-mail address `smoke+<role>-<run>@gimmi.be`. To test another environment: `E2E_BASE_URL=http://localhost:4200 npm run e2e`. The report is written to `playwright-report/`.
